When the material is mixed on site a cross linked interpenetrating network (XPN) is formed enhancing the overall material properties. By controlling the cross-linking density, the properties of Xolutec can be adjusted depending on the product performance required, e.g. this allows the formulation of materials with varying degrees of toughness and flexibility. Xolutec is very low in volatile organic components (VOC), is quick and easy to apply with both spray and hand application depending on requirements. It cures rapidly even at low temperature, reducing application time thus enabling fast return to service and minimizing downtime. This technology is not sensitive to moisture and tolerates a wide variety of different site conditions, greatly expanding the application window and reducing the potential for delays and failures. Long maintenance cycles and lower life cycle costs significantly reduce total cost of ownership.",

    "Long Description": "Sikagard® M 790 is a two-component crack-bridging membrane based on Xolutec® - Technology providing high chemical and mechanical resistance. \n  \n   \n   \n   Xolutec is an innovative and smart way of combining complementary chemistries. When the material is mixed on site a cross linked interpenetrating network (XPN) is formed enhancing the overall material properties. By controlling the cross-linking density, the properties of Xolutec can be adjusted depending on the product performance required, e.g. this allows the formulation of materials with varying degrees of toughness and flexibility. Xolutec is very low in volatile organic components (VOC), is quick and easy to apply with both spray and hand application depending on requirements. It cures rapidly even at low temperature, reducing application time thus enabling fast return to service and minimizing downtime. This technology is not sensitive to moisture and tolerates a wide variety of different site conditions, greatly expanding the application window and reducing the potential for delays and failures. Long maintenance cycles and lower life cycle costs significantly reduce total cost of ownership.",
